    <h1>Saturdays are for the Boys</h1>

    <p>As pictured above, the boys have been through strenuous debate regarding this topics. At first, it was proposed that all days should be considered for the boys.
        However, this proposition brought up a backlash from the female nations. It was deemed on this day, and by our behest that Saturdays shall be internationally
        recognized as a day that is indeed for the boys. If there are any attempts to undermine this decree please refer the perpetrator to <a href="#"> The Boys Manifesto.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>"When will this go into effect?"</h3>
    <p>Excellent question, the outline of the proposition is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This decree is effective as of 1976-07-04.</li>
        <li>Anyone who disobeys shall be referred to <a href="#">The Boys Manifesto.</a> </li>
        <li>All nations recognize this decree, no exceptions.</li>
    </ul>
